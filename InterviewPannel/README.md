# PATTERNS FOLLOWED :

- **view model :** Model-view (MV) is a software design pattern that separates an application's logic into two distinct layers:
   - *Model:* Stores and retrieves data from back-end data stores
   - *View:* Provides the user interface (UI) necessary to interact with the application
- **Singleton :** The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. It provides access to that instance from anywhere in the codebase. The singleton pattern is useful when multiple instances of a class are undesirable or a single point of control or coordination is required.
